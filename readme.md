[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_apis/build/status/neo-project.neo-fx?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_build/latest?definitionId=26&branchName=master)

This repo contains the start of the [Neo Unified Programming Model](https://github.com/ngdseattle/design-notes/blob/master/NDX-DN02%20-%20NEO-FX%20Unified%20Programming%20Model.md)
library for .NET.

The 0.9 release of Neo-Fx is primarily for the use of the [Neo Smart Contract Debugger](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger).
The 0.9 release of the debugger includes support for reading blockchain information
from [Neo-Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express) checkpoints for use
in contracts being debugged. Additional support for scenarios described in NDX-DN02
will be added in later releases.
